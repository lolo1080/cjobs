	<td class="tbl_td_content">Security Level option enables Administrator to set constrains on searches and clicks being originated from banned countries or IP addresses.<br />
			<b>Low</b> - allows searches and clicks from all countries, from any IP address. This level is the lowest one.<br />
			<b>Medium</b> - rejects clicks from banned IP address and countries. This is a medium level of security. It allows searches and clicks from banned countries and IP addresses, but only in case they are without earnings. If Affiliates execute click or search from banned country or IP address, then they are not going to be paid.<br />
			<b>High</b> - rejects searches from banned IP addresses and countries - This is high level of security. Any attempt to execute a search, click, or sign in for an account will result in block of such actions with displaying the message Your country is blocked or Your IP [IP address] is blocked. We recommend this level to protect you from any kind of fraud.
